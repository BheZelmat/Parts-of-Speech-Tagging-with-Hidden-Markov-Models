## Overview
This notebook delves into Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging, a foundational task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). It illustrates how to assign grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, etc.) to individual words in a sentence, essential for understanding sentence structure and meaning.

## Key Features
* Detailed explanation of POS tagging and its significance in NLP.
* Step-by-step guide to implementing Hidden Markov Models for POS tagging.
* Usage of Wall Street Journal datasets for training and testing.
* Preprocessing steps to handle unknown words effectively.
* Computation of transition and emission probabilities within HMM.
* Application of the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely tag sequence.
*  valuation of model accuracy on test data.

## Dependencies

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Dataset
Utilizes tagged data sets from the Wall Street Journal, providing a robust foundation for training and testing the HMM.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or apply the tagging to new data, follow the instructions detailed within the notebook, ensuring all dependencies are installed and data files are located in the specified paths.
